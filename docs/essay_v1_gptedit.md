Seriousness: The Engine of Order and Beauty

Shinya Kimura stands in his workshop, black grease up to his elbows, crafting yet another one-of-a-kind motorcycle. He hand-builds magnificent speed machines using only his internal sense of beauty as a compass. In a two-minute video portrait I saw 15 years ago, Shinya smiles wide beneath his welder’s mask – playful, yet utterly absorbed in his work. He’s not efficient by any MBA metric; collectors like Brad Pitt simply wait, salivating, for six months until Shinya finishes the next masterpiece. If Shinya Kimura didn’t exist, his designs wouldn’t magically pop out of the entropy of the universe. His seriousness – a singular focus and dedication to craft – generates beauty where there was chaos. Shinya Kimura is serious about motorcycles, and it shows.

I’m increasingly attracted to seriousness and serious people. By serious I don’t mean grave or humorless (Shinya clearly has fun), but rather an earnest, sustained commitment to creating something excellent. Serious people create beauty and structure around them, and in doing so they push back the default state of disorder. Lately we hear a lot of dismissals – “Oh, so-and-so is unserious.” It’s easy to label what we don’t like, but what does it actually mean to “do X seriously”? Instead of defining it by negation or by mere comparison (“not like those clowns” or “be like China/Vannevar Bush”), I want a positive definition of seriousness – one we can apply to ourselves and our society.

Why bother? Because today we in the West lack any clear cultural rallying cry. We grasp at shallow ideals: “Efficiency!” got us optimized widget factories and soulless corporate strip malls – and a fragile supply chain. “Diversity!” (celebrating difference for its own sake) hasn’t exactly built us a new Sistine Chapel or cured cancer. “Riches!” lead many to short-term opportunism (meme stocks, influencer hustle, or billing $2500 for an ER visit). Even “Progress!” – a noble idea – often papers over the darker sides of human nature in its cheeriness. None of these slogans, alone, will keep our civilization’s coffee hot. They don’t fight entropy.

I argue that we need to understand and venerate seriousness itself as a cultural value. Seriousness is the missing link that ties together hard infrastructure, cutting-edge science, vibrant technology and enduring progress. It is the virtue of investing sustained energy against the natural gradient of “easy come, easy go.” A serious society builds for the future instead of coasting on the present. Crucially, seriousness also acknowledges the flipside: if we fail to be serious, we court chaos.

In times of peace and plenty, it’s easy to lose seriousness – to let everything become relative, petty, frivolous. As retired Navy SEAL Sam Alaimo wisely noted, “In times of peace, everything is relative. But in wartime, everything is absolute.” Let’s pray we remain in a peaceful, prosperous era, but there’s no excuse to let peace devolve into decadence. The best cultures maintain a baseline of seriousness whether the harvest is good or bad. They don’t wade off into nonsense just because they can. Today’s tech optimists preaching abundance would do well to also read history’s harsher lessons (the ones in The Sovereign Individual or The Gulag Archipelago). Seriousness means grappling with both – the inspiring possibilities and the real risks – and forging ahead with eyes open.

So what do I mean, technically, by seriousness? In dry terms, seriousness is a system’s ability to go against energy gradients. It’s the capacity of an individual or group to inject new energy and impose structure such that something unlikely and beautiful emerges, rather than things just following the easy downhill path to chaos. In physics speak, a serious system locally reduces entropy – it carves order from the clay of randomness, at the expense of effort. If that sounds abstract, we can make it concrete. Bear with me through a bit of physics and biology, and we’ll see how seriousness can actually be quantified with three parameters. (Yes, I’m literally going to define seriousness with an equation – talk about serious!) But this isn’t just theory; it will help us recognize seriousness or the lack thereof in our world, from government policies to personal projects.

The Physics of Seriousness: Fighting Entropy

The Second Law of Thermodynamics is famously grim: in a closed system, entropy (disorder) always increases. Left to itself, the universe trends toward heat death – maximum chaos, no structure, nothing interesting. Your hot coffee will always cool to room temperature; the room won’t spontaneously heat your coffee for you. The default state of the universe is cold and lifeless. It’s honestly a miracle that anything manages to stand out above this noise floor of particles bumping aimlessly. (Astrophysicist Sean Carroll and others have written at length about the profound mystery of why we ever see pockets of order like galaxies, life, and WiFi routers in a universe ruled by entropy.)

Life does exist, though, because the Earth is not a closed system. The secret sauce is energy flow. The Second Law says entropy must increase in a closed system, but an open system can locally decrease its entropy as long as it dumps enough disorder into its surroundings. Think of a jungle: how does a lush forest flourish and become more ordered (more biomass, elaborate ecosystems) in a chaotic universe? The answer: the forest is continually importing energy – sunlight – and exporting entropy (waste heat, decay). By capturing energy from the sun and storing it in structured molecules like sugars and lignin, life creates pockets of order and beauty. As long as the sun pours energy in and the forest processes it effectively, the jungle can push back the tide of chaos. In short, energy is life. A cold, dark forest is a dead forest.

Now, let’s imagine a city or any human system as a metaphorical boat trying to sail upstream (against entropy). To keep going, it needs two things: a strong wind of energy behind it, and a well-built sail to harness that wind. In our terms, the total available energy is the wind, and the efficiency or capability of the system to use that energy is the sail. We might also add a third factor: how streamlined or turbulent the boat itself is – a boat with a tangled rigging and fighting crew won’t move forward smoothly even with good wind and sails. This “internal harmony” factor is akin to managing entropy within the system.

We can formalize this. (If you hate equations, feel free to skip ahead – the gist is coming right up.) The minimum energy required to maintain order in a growing system depends on how complex that system is. Physicists use entropy (S) to measure disorder. Entropy relates to the number of microscopic configurations (W for “ways”) a system can have. A simple proverb explains it: “One dog is one dog, but two dogs are ten dogs.” In other words, the complexity (and potential chaos) doesn’t increase linearly with more parts – it can explode combinatorially. Two dogs together can get into far more mischief than one alone (there are many more possible interactions). In physics, this idea is captured by Boltzmann’s famous formula: S = k·ln(W). Without getting too technical, if a system has N components (people, dogs, machines) that can interact, the number of possible states W often grows faster than N. We might express it as something like W ∼ N^α for some exponent α > 1, or more precisely, W = M^(N^α) if each pair of components can interact in M different ways. The exact form isn’t important; what matters is the exponent α tells us how entangled the system is. If α = 1, adding more pieces only increases possible chaos linearly. If α = 2, the chaos potential goes up quadratically with N (think N choose 2 interactions).

α as connectivity: α reflects how interconnected the system’s parts are. If α ≈ 1, each agent is relatively isolated or neatly siloed – like soldiers on a parade ground or monks in separate cells. If α is closer to 2, every agent is bumping into every other – like an unruly marketplace or a fully open chat room. α = 2 is basically a mob – maximum social entropy. Values of α between 1 and 2 imply something in-between: a lightly structured society where some order exists but everyone isn’t in everyone else’s business all the time. Researchers have actually tried to measure α in real systems. For instance, in actual cities, efficiencies in infrastructure counteract some of the social messiness; one famous study estimated about α ≈ 0.85 for the scaling of cities. Conversely, online communities can reach α alarmingly close to 2: a 2013 analysis of Wikipedia and news forums found α ~1.9 in the semi-moderated ones and even higher in chaotic, unmoderated online free-for-alls. Intuitively, this makes sense – on the internet, everyone can theoretically interact with everyone (hence the chaos feels “maxed out” at times).

Now, the Second Law dictates that as a system’s entropy potential increases (with more components and higher α connectivity), it takes more work (energy input) to maintain or build order. Roughly, the power needed to keep entropy at bay grows with something like dS/dt ~ α · N^(α–1) · (dN/dt) (you don’t need to remember that formula, just catch the drift: more stuff and more connected stuff = more entropy to fight). If we don’t put in enough energy or if we waste energy, disorder wins – the boat drifts backward.

This yields a very simple framework for Seriousness Power:

Seriousness (power)
  
∝
  
𝐸
avail
×
𝑣
  
≥
  
(entropy growth demand)
.
Seriousness (power)∝E
avail
	​

×v≥(entropy growth demand).

In plainer terms:

E (Energy availability): How much total usable energy or resources can we pour into the system? (This is the “wind in the sails.”)

v (Efficiency/capability): How good are our “sails”? – i.e. what fraction of that energy can we actually harness for useful work, given our technology, skills, and institutions? This covers everything from technological efficiency to organizational competence.

α (Interconnectivity/chaos factor): How ordered or turbulent is our internal structure? Are we a disciplined crew rowing in unison (low α), or a chaotic mob where every interaction spawns new friction (high α)?

To grow or even just to maintain order against entropy, a system must maximize the first two and manage the third: Increase E, improve v, keep α in check. In a nutshell:

Pump in more energy – E is life. A serious effort almost always requires significant energy, capital, or effort inflow. (No, there is no free lunch; you can’t power a factory on vibes or run a civilization on feel-good slogans.)

Raise efficiency and capability (v) – Build better engines, better institutions, smarter processes. It’s not just raw energy that matters, but how effectively you convert energy into progress.

Restrain internal chaos (α) – Encourage productive interactions and community structure, but prevent total free-for-all dynamics. Absolute top-down control (α → 1) is stifling, but a completely “do your own thing” society (α → 2) dissolves into noise and conflict. Serious systems find the sweet spot of cohesion without oppression.

Nature’s Playbook: Life vs. Chaos

If this trio E–v–α seems abstract, just look at biology. Life on Earth has been winning against entropy for ~3.5 billion years, so it must be doing something right. How do living systems increase E, increase v, and manage α?

First, life grabs energy wherever it can. Plants capture sunlight; myriad microbes break down chemicals; we animals gobble plants and other animals. Life is a greedy energy importer. That’s E.

Second, life is amazingly good at efficiently using energy. This is where structure comes in. Inside every cell, there are membranes, organelles, and catalysts (enzymes) ensuring that energy is harnessed, not wasted. A pivotal discovery in 20th-century biology was that cells make the energy-storage molecule ATP using proton gradients across a membrane – basically charging a tiny battery by separating ions. This was the controversial chemiosmotic theory proposed by Peter Mitchell in 1961. Mitchell suggested that instead of a single magical chemical fueling life, it was the structure of the mitochondrial membrane – pumping protons to one side – that allowed cells to efficiently produce ATP. The idea was initially ridiculed (Mitchell got kicked out of his university lab for this heresy), but he persisted in his garage lab and was ultimately proven correct, winning a Nobel Prize. The moral: life achieves high v (efficiency) through compartmentalization and order. By setting up gradients and boundaries (like membranes that keep protons or nutrients in the right place), organisms dramatically increase the usable work they get from raw energy. In essence, beauty and structure are the conduits for energy to become life. Without the beautiful intricate architecture of a cell, all the sunlight in the world would just chaotically heat the soup of primordial oceans and nothing organized would emerge.

Finally, life manages α (interactions) by layers of order: cells form tissues, tissues form organs, organs form organisms, organisms form structured societies (at least in social species like us). Inside a healthy cell or a healthy ecosystem, not everything interacts with everything else arbitrarily. There are channels, feedback loops, and hierarchies. For example, your body keeps certain reactions isolated in organelles; a wolf pack has dominance structure to prevent constant fights. Too much free-for-all interaction (α too high) and the system collapses into parasitism or conflict. Too little interaction (α too low) and you’re basically inert – no cooperation, no synergy.

A vivid way to see the difference is to compare a tree and a fungus. Both are living, but they embody opposite strategies:

A tree is serious. It stands upright, builds tall trunk and branches (orderly structure), and spends decades harnessing sunlight and water to grow against gravity. It actively pumps energy in and stores it as wood, creating a whole micro-ecosystem of order (a habitat). If that tree didn’t exist, you could wait eons and you’d never get exactly that structure by random chance. The tree is fighting entropy daily – it’s a local entropy-reducing machine.

A fungus, on the other hand, is the great decomposer. Fungi are vital to the cycle of life, but in our analogy they represent passivity: they mostly consume the energy already stored in the environment (like in fallen logs, dead organisms) and disperse it. A mushroom can pop up overnight on the tree’s remains, using the tree’s concentrated energy to briefly make a delicate structure – which then spews spores and decays back into mush. In a sense, fungi accelerate entropy; they thrive when other order has failed. They don’t add new energy into the system; they ride the gradient downward, breaking structure back into chaos.

So when thinking about seriousness, think of the tree versus the fungus. The serious path is hard: invest energy to build something unlikely, withstand the elements, contribute lasting structure. The opposite path is much easier: take whatever you can from those who came before and let it all eventually rot. We need decomposers in nature, but human cultures can’t survive if everyone becomes a free-rider consuming the legacy of the serious ancestors without renewal. Seriousness is what creates new legacy.

(As an aside, physicist Erwin Schrödinger anticipated a lot of this in his 1944 essay What is Life?. He observed that living organisms feed on “negative entropy” – they maintain order by exporting disorder to their environment – and he stressed how stable structures (like the genetic code) are key to life’s defiance of chaos. Our discussion of membranes, order, and energy would likely have made Schrödinger smile.)

Seriousness in Society: Case Studies

How do these principles play out in the human world? Let’s consider a couple of real-world examples of seriousness – or the lack thereof – in action:

Manufacturing and National Policy: The gutting of American manufacturing over the past few decades was, in a word, unserious. By “unserious” I mean it followed the path of least resistance – chasing short-term efficiency gains and cost savings (riding an existing gradient) rather than investing to create new capabilities. Highly-educated consultants and executives from McKinsey or Goldman Sachs weren’t being geniuses when they offshored factories to cheaper labor markets; any MBA student could see the immediate profit bump of outsourcing. But it was a fungal move: it exploited an existing energy gradient (cheaper energy/labor elsewhere) and hollowed out domestic industry in the process. In contrast, it was profoundly serious of China to accept that work. The Chinese leadership and workforce poured massive energy (E) into building industrial capacity from scratch. They trained engineers, constructed infrastructure (improving v, the efficiency of utilizing resources), and coordinated government and society toward becoming the “factory of the world” (imposing structure to manage α). It took decades of serious effort, but it paid off in a resilient manufacturing ecosystem that can now spawn new innovations. The U.S., by treating industry as a bothersome mess to outsource, lost energy input, atrophied its productive v, and now suffers higher α in the form of social discontent and political finger-pointing over lost jobs. The lesson: you can’t skip maintaining the “sail and boat” and expect to keep going upstream.

A National ‘Seriousness’ Check – The UK: Present-day Britain unfortunately illustrates what happens when all three seriousness factors falter. The UK is a wealthy, brainy nation – yet it’s been floundering with stagnation and disorder in recent years. On the E front, British households and businesses have been hit with some of the highest energy costs in the developed world, a result of poor long-term planning and heavy reliance on imports. Infrastructure and public services (v) have likewise fallen into disrepair – from crumbling railways and chronic train delays to aging water systems leaking sewage. This means even the energy and resources they do have are used sub-optimally. And socially (α), Britain has struggled to maintain cohesion amid rapid change: roughly 16% of people living in the UK were born abroad (a sign of vibrant diversity, but also a challenge for integration), and in recent years “Muhammad” (in various spellings) has topped the list of baby boy names. There’s nothing wrong with diversity – in fact it can be a source of strength – but if not accompanied by a strong unifying culture or shared vision, a highly fragmented society can drift toward chaos or conflict. High α doesn’t magically come down on its own. The UK’s current struggles with strikes, political upheaval, and policy drift reflect these compounding issues: not enough energy input into the system, not enough efficiency in utilizing resources, and a fraying social fabric. It’s a cautionary tale of a system that needs to get serious, lest entropy take the wheel.

We could list many more examples. In science policy, a serious approach would mean funding ambitious, long-term research (not just safe, incremental papers) and building institutions that capture public imagination – in other words, upping E (funding, talent) and v (efficient R&D structures). An unserious approach is to let labs scramble for tiny grants and chase trendy topics, slowly bleeding out the scientific enterprise. In culture, a serious movement produces great art, architecture, and education that uplift and discipline people; an unserious culture fixates on passing fads and shock value, contributing little to future generations. At the extreme, consider the chaos of the Joker in Batman’s Gotham – the very embodiment of entropy and nihilism – who exists to tear down structure and mock any earnest purpose. It’s no coincidence that the Joker’s greatest threat is to the serious people and institutions of Gotham; chaos attacks seriousness wherever it finds it. We must be vigilant in defending and rekindling seriousness in our institutions and in ourselves.

To summarize the pattern:

Passive, “unserious” systems tend to exploit existing gradients without adding new structure. They take the easy wins (consume energy that’s readily available, leverage old infrastructure until it breaks, allow social interactions to run amok or become totally unmoored from shared values). These systems might appear to flourish for a time, but they create little novel order. They ride on the momentum of the past – until entropy catches up.

Serious systems, by contrast, invest energy deliberately to create new, higher levels of order. They build infrastructure instead of just using it up. They seed new industries and ideas (establishing fresh gradients uphill for others to climb). They actively cultivate social cohesion and purpose, so that increased size or diversity doesn’t turn into fractious instability. In thermodynamic terms, a serious system is always looking for ways to import more energy and put it to work in a structured manner, exporting the entropy harmlessly elsewhere (like heat to space, or problems solved rather than exacerbated).

Can We Measure Seriousness? (A Thought Experiment)

At this point, we have a conceptual framework: Seriousness = E × v (with a handle on α), and we’ve seen qualitative examples. But can we actually quantify how serious a given person, project, or policy is? This ventures into speculative territory – and perhaps a bit of Asimovian science-fiction – but it’s a provocative thought. If seriousness is about contributing energy, efficiency, and order to a system, maybe we can score entities on those axes. In fact, I tried a little experiment with GPT-4, asking it to rate various entities on E, v, and α contributions using the definitions we discussed. (Psychohistory fans, eat your heart out – we’re doing a tiny version of Hari Seldon’s math for culture!)

Scoring Seriousness with AI (skip ahead to the conclusion if you’re not into the nerdy part):

I prompted an AI model with a structured rubric to evaluate how an entity (a person or organization) affects a given system’s seriousness. The prompt defined E as the entity’s contribution to energy/resources, v as its contribution to efficiency or capability, and α as its effect on social/order structure (with positive meaning it reduces chaos). The AI was asked to output a JSON with scores from -1 to +1 for each factor, plus a rationale. For example, a visionary inventor who creates new technology might score E: +0.6 (brings in resources and inspiration), v: +0.8 (greatly improves efficiency with new tools), α: +0.5 (somewhat improves social order by inspiring others or building institutions). A nihilistic provocateur, on the other hand, might score zeros in E and v and a negative in α for actively sowing discord.

I won’t digress into full results here, but it was striking that the AI could follow this thermodynamic metaphor and debate, say, whether Project 2025 (a proposed U.S. political agenda) is “more serious” than Robin DiAngelo’s White Fragility book, based on how each one might add or drain energy from society, improve or hinder efficiency, and create unity or discord. The exercise isn’t about the AI being “correct” – it’s about forcing ourselves to articulate why something pushes civilization uphill or downhill. You can find the exact prompt and output format in the Appendix below, but the takeaway is: seriousness can be a lens. We can try to objectively assess leaders and ideas for whether they’re truly building something that will last or just coasting and complaining.

(Alan Kay once quipped about education: “Some people measure progress in answers-right-per-test or tests-passed-per-year; I’m more interested in Sistine-Chapel-Ceilings per lifetime.” In other words, judge a system by the highest brilliance it enables, not the easiest metrics. That’s the kind of thinking a “seriousness score” hopes to encourage.)

Conclusion: Mr. Rogers – A Hero of Seriousness

It’s time to end on an uplifting note, because seriousness, despite its stern name, is ultimately hopeful and life-affirming. And there’s no better hero of serious living than Fred McFeely Rogers – yes, the gentle Mr. Rogers from children’s television. He may not seem like a “technical” figure, but Mr. Rogers was deadly serious about one thing: children’s well-being and moral development. Through that lens, he harnessed tremendous energy, efficiency, and order in the service of good.

Think about E (Energy): Mr. Rogers poured personal energy and passion into his show for decades. He also rallied external resources – convincing broadcasters and even the U.S. Congress to support quality children’s programming. (His famous 1969 Senate testimony is a masterclass in seriousness: in six minutes of heartfelt, principled argument, he won over a skeptical Senator and secured funding for PBS. That’s a real-world example of injecting energy into a system – in this case, public media – by sheer earnest conviction.)

Consider v (Efficiency/Capability): Mr. Rogers was a master of using television (the high-tech medium of his time) in an efficient, cutting-edge way to educate. He had degrees in music composition and child psychology; he designed an entire pedagogical framework for his show. Every song, puppet, and storyline was carefully crafted to help children understand their emotions and the world around them. He took the relatively new resource of TV and dramatically increased its value as an educational tool. In thermodynamic terms, he raised the conversion efficiency of broadcast time into enlightenment and comfort for kids. Unlike flashy shows that just filled time between ads, Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood was optimized for growth – the personal growth of viewers.

And most importantly, α (Social Structure): Mr. Rogers built community and order everywhere he went. On his show, he fostered a calm, kind neighborhood where everyone was welcome. Off-screen, he exemplified integrity and routine – he had almost monastic daily habits, swimming every morning, composing songs, responding to every fan letter. He bridged differences with empathy. In the fractious world of television, he stood for an utterly cohesive set of values. He basically lowered the social entropy around him by teaching generations of children about kindness, self-worth, and how to deal with tough feelings instead of lashing out. Mr. Rogers showed that seriousness doesn’t mean lack of humor or warmth – it means devotion to a cause, with compassion and discipline in equal measure. He famously said, “I think of discipline as the continual everyday process of helping a child learn self-discipline.” He applied that same continual discipline to himself and his mission.

Fred Rogers, in short, created beauty and structure out of the chaotic medium of TV and the turbulent process of growing up. If that’s not serious, I don’t know what is. And he did it all with a smile and a closet full of cozy cardigans.

In a world teetering between possibility and entropy, we could all use a bit more seriousness – the joyous, determined kind that builds Sistine Chapels, space telescopes, life-saving technologies, lasting communities, and loving neighborhoods. Seriousness is not dour; it is the engine of order and beauty. It’s what turns a random assemblage of parts into a work of art, a struggling nation into a thriving civilization, a childhood TV show into a lifelong lesson. So the next time we pitch an idea or choose a leader or start a project, let’s ask: Are we doing this seriously? And if not, how can we bring a little more seriousness to the table – a little more energy, a little more ingenuity, and a little more heart?

Appendix: The “Seriousness” Scoring Prompt (for the technically curious)

Here is the actual prompt I gave to GPT-4 to evaluate entities on seriousness. It’s a bit dense, but essentially it encodes the E, v, α framework into a set of instructions and asks for a JSON output. This is more of a provocation than a definitive test – the value is in how it makes us think about the elements of seriousness in concrete situations.

{"entity": "<name>",
 "system": "<the system or context being impacted>",
 "scores": {
   "E": <float from -1 to 1>,
   "v": <float from -1 to 1>,
   "alpha": <float from -1 to 1>
 },
 "rationale": "<80-120 word explanation focusing on how the entity adds or subtracts energy (E), improves or worsens efficiency/capability (v), and increases or decreases social cohesion/order (alpha).>"}


Scoring criteria:

E (Energy) – Does the entity contribute resources, talent, capital, or new energy to the system (+1), or does it drain/obstruct resources (-1)?

v (Efficiency) – Does the entity improve the system’s ability to use resources, via better tech, skills, or structures (+1), or create inefficiency and waste (-1)?

α (Order) – Does the entity foster unity, stability, and constructive interaction (+1) or sow discord, fragmentation, and chaos (-1)? (Note: For α we invert the sign – reducing chaos is positive.)

For example, an institution-builder like Vannevar Bush might get something like:

"scores": { "E": 0.7, "v": 0.9, "alpha": 0.6 }


with a rationale about mobilizing R&D funding (E), creating efficient structures like the NSF (v), and uniting academia, industry, and government around common goals (lowering α).

Whereas a demagogue might score:

"scores": { "E": -0.2, "v": -0.5, "alpha": -0.8 }


with explanation that they drive away talent and investment, break institutions, and turn groups against each other.

The point isn’t the exact numbers – it’s to force a clear-eyed look at how someone or something is affecting our shared voyage against entropy. Is it adding wind to our sails, building a better sail, steering the boat steadily… or drilling holes in the hull? Seriousness demands we ask these questions.
