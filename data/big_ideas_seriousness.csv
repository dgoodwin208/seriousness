However, implementation remains fragmented across jurisdictions with coordination challenges between federal, state, and local levels. The political polarization around climate issues has created uneven adaptation landscapes, with some regions advancing rapidly while others lag. The system's ability to convert resources into effective adaptation outcomes is hampered by institutional barriers and competing priorities, resulting in implementation gaps between planning and execution. The contested nature stems from the negative alpha score indicating coordination challenges despite positive resource and infrastructure dimensions.",Implementation of comprehensive federal and state-level climate adaptation infrastructure and policies that effectively protect vulnerable communities and critical systems from climate impacts
